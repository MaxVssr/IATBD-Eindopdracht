## About Time2Share

This Laravel app was created by me for my bachelor in Computer
I am still developing my Laravel skills, feedback is appreciated!

## Before you use this app

1. Run ```composer install``` within the folder of the project.
2. Edit the ```.env``` file and add the database you want to use (use ```.env.example``` is an example).
3. Run the commands ```php artisan migrate``` and ```php artisan db:seed```.
4. Run the command ```php artisan storage:link```**
5. Everything is set! Run ```php artisan serve``` and open in your browser.

** Without this you won't be able to access the images from the "Add Product" form.
